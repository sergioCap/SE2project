Note Prof. Mottola said:
For your project, you can either ask us (Elisabetta and I) here if you think 
it is a major issue, or simply come up with realistic, feasible, and properly 
motivated assumptions. The motivations will need to be part of the RASD anyways.

#1 CONCERNING ACTORS OF OUR SYSTEM

Professor Di Nitto says:
Your system needs to have some operators otherwise your cars will soon 
remain far away and with no battery. 
You need at least to reason on this and then make a decision on what 
you want to assume (interfaces for operators could be within the b
oundaries of your software to be or they could be pre-existing ones, 
and in this case you will need to understand how to interface with them...)

Boundaries of the system are not always obvious. 
We must not forget to identify and define them explicitly.

MY THOUGHT
I think we could assume that there are operators that do interventions or 
check the status of cars and contact eventually the maintenance.

I would suggest this to be part of the ASSUMPTIONS.

#2 CONCERNING PAYMENT METHODS

Professor Mottola says:
One issue is what happens when a user, for whatever reason, cannot complete a 
payment. 
The project description generally talks about "payment information", not about 
(rechargeable) credit cards. 
Have you negotiated with your customer that payments are only going to use 
this means? 
In any case, it is your job to come up with a reasonable set of assumptions 
on how payments take place, and thus on the chances that a payment cannot 
complete, if at all.

The other issue is what to do with users unable to complete a payment sometime 
in the past. 
Preventing them from using the service for a given amount of time looks like a 
reasonable option to me, as long as this remains consistent with the assumptions 
you make to address the first issue.

More than the specific details, I think this is a case that shows how fundamental 
it is to separate out different concerns and to capture their relationships.

MY THOUGHT
As reported in the problem at point 6: "the system starts charging the user for 
a given amount of money per minute; the user is notified of the current charge 
through a screen on the car"

I would avoid credit card as method for these reasons:
- if there is not enough money at the end of the ride the system will never 
know when to charge unless it tries many times until the user recharges its card;
- how should the system behave in cases in which it discovers the user can't be 
charged?

My suggestion:
I would use a "budget" function working this way:
- the user charges an amount of money on his profile (using credit card payment 
for example, like on Amazon or any other web shop);
- once the user puts money on his profile the system already gets all the money;
- on his profile the user knows the available amount;
- after the ride there are two possibilities
	1: money is enough (e.g. available 10 €, ride 3€, remaining 7€);
	2: not enough money (available 10€, ride 11€, remaining -1€);
- in case 1 everything is ok;
- in case 2 the user has 7 days to recharge before being removed from the 
service and being obliged to pay the missing money, also, user will be
unable to reserve cars until the moment he recharges;

This solves the problems described before concerning credit card (when to retry 
payment? how to behave with the user?)

#3 CONCERNING TEMPORARY PARKING

Name of topic: Temporary parking outside a safe area

Professor Mottola says:
It is entirely up to you to decide if and how to support this, even if it's not 
explicitly listed in the project description. The important bit is to ensure 
that whatever decision you take here does not impact any of the functionality 
the customer is explicitly asking for, which are listed in the document. 
The risk of introducing inconsistencies is always there. 

---
MY THOUGHT
I would avoid this by only allowing pick the car - use it - park it.
Users need again the car? 
Open the app - search for cars - pick a car - use it - park it.

WHY?
It would complicate things, isn't it?

#4 CONCERNING SAFE PARKING AREAS

Professor Di Nitto says:
The document you have got from your customer says: "The set of safe areas for 
parking cars is pre-defined by the management system". 
So, it seems that your customer has clear ideas of what a safe area is and you 
can make the assumption that at start-up time your system will be inizialized 
with such a set of safe areas. Since the text is talking about "set" of areas, 
we can imagine that it will be composed by a number of elements, not only one 
as you are assuming when you consider the whole city as a safe area (of course, 
we can have sets composed of a single element or not elements at all, but we 
neeed to be able to handle also the general case). 
What you have to understand is how your customer is providing information 
about these areas. He/she could provide you with an address that corresponds 
to the area or with a set of coordinates... 
From our perspective, you are free to make your choice here and motivate and 
document it in the RASD
