##Software Interfaces

##Product Perspective
The system interfaces with an external Data Collecting System for getting real-time information about cars and Power Plugs status trought API exposed by this system. The Data Collecting System should allow Power Enjoy system to access to cars and Power Plugs informations and to set the led on the Power Plug.
For payments, our system interfaces with an external Payment System sending all payment data such as credit cards information and the total amount to be payed. Given these informations, the payments system performs the payment and should send a feedback to our system.

##Identifying stakeholders
The stackholder of this project is PowerEnjoy Company, a new company born from a famous Energy distribution company, that decided to build from zero a car sharing service that whould offer a service to the citizens that would be convenable and at the same time eco-friendly.
