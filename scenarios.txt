Scenario 1
Alice gets out with friends but when she wants to come back home there are no buses,
so she decides to take a PowerEnjoy. She opens the application (she's already logged in)
and on the map she checks for the closest available car. She finds some and she decides
to reserve one, that's 10 min from her by feet. When she arrives at the car, she
presses the button to pickit up and after a few seconds the car opens. She starts
driving. When she arrives home, she parks in the first available parking space and
presses the button to notify she's leaving the car. She closes the door and she waits
till the car locks.

unreserve possible?
